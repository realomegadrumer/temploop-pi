# temploop-pi
Basically a single Python script that updates the CPU temperature on the output every second. Meant to work on the Raspberry Pi.

# Usage
All you really have to do is download the Python script provided, open up a terminal of your liking, navigate to its contained directory, and spit out these magic words:

`python temploop.py`

...and that's it. To terminate the program, just hit Ctrl+C.
